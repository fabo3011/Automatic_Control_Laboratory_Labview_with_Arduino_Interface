# Automatic Control Laboratory Labview with Arduino Interface
This repository develops an interface using Arduino and Labview to interact with a first and second order linear system processes using different types of controllers and parameters.

This Interface is for the Automatic Control Laboratory class at Instituto Tecnologico de Monterrey campus Queretaro.


# Libraries needed for the Arduino Program

- The library "Filters.h" is required for the program to compile. It can be found at: https://github.com/JonHub/Filters (A realtime digital signal processing DSP library for Arduino)
